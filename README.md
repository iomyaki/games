# Tic-tac-toe
Programming a tic-tac-toe aka noughts and crosses aka Xs and Os.

Different approaches:
1) XO_two_players.py — classic tic-tac-toe for two human players;
2) XO_two_players_nxn.py — a game for two human players with the arbitrary size of the field (still square);
3) XO_AI_random.py — a game with random computer's turns, human starts;
4) XO_AI_perfect_noughts.py — a game with a perfect AI (not possible to win), human starts;
5) XO_AI_perfect_crosses.py — a game with a perfect AI (not possible to win), computer starts [IN PROGRESS];
6) XO_classes.py — an attempt to implement a game using OOP [IN PROGRESS].
